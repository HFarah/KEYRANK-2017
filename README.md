# KEYRANK-2017

This repository contains all the experimental results obtained during the evaluation of KeyRanker's performance. It is organized as follows:
- "Evaluation" directory: includes the experimental results obtained in the form of slides.
- "Dataset" directory: contains the benchmarks used for the various experimental evaluations.
- "Tools" directory: contains the versions of the tools we used (SAKey, LIMES, SILK)

A version of KeyRanker with the user manual will soon be added to the repository.
